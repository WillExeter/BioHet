Want to make a script which will automate AF2 multimer predictions which will work with heteromers. Taking a list of PDB1 and FASTA filenames will go in and identify how many copies of each subunit are in the biological assembly, extract the FASTAs for each and write to an AF input file. Then will make a .sh file which constructs the AF2 commands including filenames, then this can be run after running python script.
